<h1>About</h1>

<p>
	<%= link_to "pInGoodHealth","http:\\www.pInGoodHealth.com" %> is a healthcare information sharing resource. Anyone with or close to someone with a health condition can share information you've found on the web with others. We all know (or at least should) that just because it's on the Internet doesn't make it necessarily helpful. That's why we've created pInGoodHealth. You can help others like you wade through the mounds of healthcare information online and make sense of it all.

<h2>Here's how:</h2>
<div>
		<ol>
			<li>Sign up for an account.</li>
			<li>Pin a site with info you find helpful.</li>
			<li>Rate the quality of the info.</li>
		</ol>
</div>

<h3>That's it! But if you want to do more, rate what others have pinned.</h3>
<p>That way, others can zero in the best health info out there. When they feel they've become pros at handling their own health, they can pay it forward!</p>
